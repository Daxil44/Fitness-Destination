Creatine is a natural amino acid present in muscles. Supplemental Creatine increases the efficiency of ATP cycle in muscle cells, enhancing your strength and work capacity. Creatinine, on the other hand, is produced by the breakdown of creatine or phosphocreatine by your muscles. Under normal conditions, your body produces creatinine at a constant rate. Creatinine is filtered out of your blood by your kidneys and removed in the urine.

<p className="Blogpara">
Creatinine itself is non-toxic but an elevated creatinine level indicates your kidneys are not filtering waste, some of which may be toxic. If you are currently consuming creatine, your blood test might show higher than normal levels of creatinine but it is not a true marker of poor kidney function (some other test will be required to draw a conclusion). Creatine is the most thoroughly studied sports supplement and studies have found no link between creatine monohydrate and kidney damage.

<h3> Generally safe</h3>
<p className="Blogpara">
Creatine might benefit athletes who need short bursts of speed or increased muscle strength, such as sprinters, weight lifters and team sport athletes.

While taking creatine might not help all athletes, evidence suggests that it generally won't hurt if taken as directed.

Although an older case study suggested that creatine might worsen kidney dysfunction in people with kidney disorders, creatine doesn't appear to affect kidney function in healthy people

<h3>Safety and side effects</h3>  
<p className="Blogpara">
When used orally at appropriate doses, creatine is likely safe to take for up to five years. As with any dietary supplement, it's important to choose a product that follows recommended manufacturing practices and subscribes to third-party testing to ensure the product's quality.

Creatine can cause:

Weight gain, generally as lean body mass
Creatine might be unsafe for people with preexisting kidney problems. However, further research is needed.
