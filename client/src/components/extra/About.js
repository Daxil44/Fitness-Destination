	The most important purpose of our platform is to provide all essential information (Supplement, BMI report, Equipment like dumbbell) about fitness at one place.

	Furthermore, the website will also provide service of blogs, where famous dietitian and fitness trainer will devote their knowledge.
    Weâ€™re all a family that loves to be healthy and fit, but when it comes to supplements to support it, we found it hard to find a good and authentic place, with the right products and at the right price! 
 
    The problem with all available online stores was that all options were a marketplace. This means that the website was not delivering the products but only acted as a platform where anyone can come and sell their products. This is not the best situation when you need to ensure 100% authenticity of products as the website selling these never know what the 3rd party seller is actually sending to the customer via their website
